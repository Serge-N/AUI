# Description
In Africa record keeping and livestock management has always been a challenge. To solve this the school requested
for software to help small scale farmers keep their records and manage there livestock. 
This has many benefits which may not be discussed here.
Request a report from the school if you are interested. 

It is important to stress that this application is a **Minimum Viable Product**, to use this in production would require
integration and unit testing. Some parts of the code would require refactoring.

Some important features include livestock near realtime animal tracking, multiple farm support, multiple users and multimedia support to efficiently 
store livestock pictures. All farmers are assumed to belong to single business firm. This is to secure the data and offer an opportunity to analyse 
the data using machine learning. Doing so gives deeper business insights.
